# projectPython_image-BxW
## Overview
**projectPython_image-BxW** is a Python-based tool designed to convert images into black-and-white (grayscale) versions. This project focuses on transforming colored images into their grayscale counterparts, which can be useful for various applications such as image preprocessing, artistic effects, or enhancing image features for analysis.

## Features
**. Image Conversion:** Converts any colored image to a black-and-white (grayscale) version.

**. Batch Processing:** Supports the conversion of multiple images at once.
Customizable Output: Allows users to specify the output format and resolution.

**. Simple and Efficient:** Designed with a straightforward interface for ease of use.

## Installation
To install and run the project locally, follow these steps:

**1. Clone the Repository:**
